# Project Phase 3 - Further Development

## 1. Enhancement Overview

- **Development Focus**: Implemented additional features based on Phase 1 use cases and Phase 2 feedback
- **Key Improvements**: 
  - Enhanced user experience through UI refinements.
  - Added History page for better tracking of user activities.
  - Improved automation for build and deployment processes.
  - Centralized error handling and debugging mechanisms.
  - Optimized performance in critical workflows.
  - Configured HTTP-only cookies for secure session management.
  - Built session verification functionality in the backend.

## 2. Backend Enhancements

- **Technology**: Extended existing Node.js/Express backend
- **New Features**:
  - Implemented HTTP-only cookies for secure session management.
  - Added robust data validation middleware to ensure input integrity.
  - Built backend session validation endpoint at `/auth/status`.
  - Enhanced error handling using `utils/AppError.js` for consistent error responses.
  - Improved debugging and logging mechanisms for better traceability.
- **Performance**:
  - Optimized error handling to provide meaningful information to the frontend.
  - Enhanced security and reduced vulnerabilities through best practices.

## 3. Frontend Upgrades

- **Technology**: Expanded React.js implementation
- **New Components**:
  - Added History page for tracking past calculations.
  - Integrated real-time data visualization charts for better insights.
  - Enhanced feedback and error handling mechanisms for improved user experience.
- **Improvements**:
  - Designed a user-friendly UI with intuitive navigation.
  - Ensured safe and secure implementation practices.

## 4. Architecture Refinements

- **Pattern**: Enhanced MVC architecture
- **Structural Improvements**:
  - Created shared utility modules for reusable functionalities (e.g., `utils/AppError.js`).
  - Centralized middleware for authentication and validation (e.g., `middleware/auth.js`, `middleware/validateLoginUser.js`, `middleware/validateRegisterUser.js`).
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated architecture diagrams to reflect the current structure.
  - Added a decision log for key changes in the architecture.

## 5. Additional Functionalities

- **Use Cases Implemented**:
  - [Use Case 1 from Phase 1] - Fully implemented with robust testing.
  - [Use Case 2 from Phase 1] - Partially implemented with key features.
  - [New Use Case] - Developed based on user feedback to address specific needs.
- **Deployment and Testing**:
  - All functionalities are built using three Docker images (backend, frontend, and database).
  - GitHub Actions is used for automated build and deployment pipelines.
  - `mySet.sh` script is utilized for local testing and environment setup.

## 6. Code Quality Improvements

- **Refactoring**:
  - Extracted duplicate code into shared modules.
  - Improved type safety with TypeScript migration.
  - Standardized API response formats.
- **Documentation**:
  - Added JSDoc to all new functions.
  - Created API usage examples.
  - Updated README with new features.

## 7. Future Recommendations

1. Implement additional security features.
2. Add more comprehensive analytics.
3. Expand mobile responsiveness.
4. Develop an admin dashboard for monitoring.
5. Deploy the database with dedicated cloud database services and set up load balancing.
